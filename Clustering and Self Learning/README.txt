FOR Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

	I have used this as a help tool to build the Dedogram in the pdf file. This does 	not include the full implementation of Hierarchical clustering.  

How to run:
	python <file_name>.py

FOR Yarowsky Algorithm.py

	Implements Self learning using logistic regression as a global classifier. 
	The accuracy of prediction on the testing data comes out to be
	
	Accuracy =  100.0	

How to run:
	python <file_name>.py

FOR Unsupervised vs Logistic

	This is an implementation of logistic regression on the test data only once. No 	bagging routine for self 	learning has been used. 

	Accuracy =  87.5

How to run:
	python <file_name>.py

The difference in accuracy is (100 - 87.5). Self-learning on the dataset drastically improves the accuracy.
